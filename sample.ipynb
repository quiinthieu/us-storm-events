    "# Case Study: Analyzing U.S. Storm Events for Disaster Preparedness \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will analyze storm event data to enhance disaster preparedness efforts in the U.S. We will follow a structured data analysis workflow comprising the following phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ask**: Define the problem and confirm expectations.\n",
    "2. **Prepare**: Collect and store data for analysis.\n",
    "3. **Process**: Clean and transform data to ensure integrity.\n",
    "4. **Analyze**: Use data analysis tools to draw conclusions.\n",
    "5. **Share**: Interpret and communicate results to make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "6. **Act**: Put insights to work to address the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize the open-source Storm Event Database provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), available at [NOAA Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp). This dataset contains comprehensive information about various storm events across the U.S., including details such as event type, location, and impact."

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The U.S. experiences various storm events that can impact public safety, property, and infrastructure. Analyzing the patterns and impacts of these storms will provide insights that can inform disaster preparedness and response strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions\n",
    "1. **What types of storm events are most prevalent in the U.S.?**  \n",
    "   Identify the most common storm events and their geographical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Where do storm events most frequently occur?**  \n",
    "   Map the geographical distribution of storm events to identify high-risk areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are certain regions more prone to specific types of storm events?**  \n",
    "   Analyze the geographic hot spots for storm types to develop tailored regional preparedness plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the temporal distribution of storm events?**  \n",
    "   Analyze trends over time to understand seasonal patterns and changes in frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is the impact of different storm events on injuries, fatalities, and property damage?**  \n",
    "   Assess the severity of various storm types and their associated risks to prioritize high-risk events for preparedness planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How can this analysis inform disaster preparedness initiatives?**  \n",
    "   Determine actionable insights that can help stakeholders enhance response plans and allocate resources effectively."

    "### Outline for Python Notebook: Storm Event Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Ask**\n",
    "   - **Define the Problem**\n",
    "     - Identify the key questions: \n",
    "       - What types of storms are most common in the US?\n",
    "       - Where do most storms originate?\n",
    "       - How do storms impact communities (injuries, deaths, damage)?\n",
    "   - **Confirm Stakeholder Expectations**\n",
    "     - Define what stakeholders expect from the analysis (e.g., actionable insights, visualizations).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Prepare**\n",
    "   - **Collect Data**\n",
    "     - Load the storm event dataset using `pandas`.\n",
    "     - Explore the dataset structure using `info()`, `head()`, and `describe()`.\n",
    "   - **Store Data**\n",
    "     - Save any preliminary data transformations or filtered datasets for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Process**\n",
    "   - **Clean the Data**\n",
    "     - Handle missing values and outliers.\n",
    "     - Convert data types as necessary (e.g., date parsing).\n",
    "   - **Transform Data**\n",
    "     - Standardize column names to snake_case.\n",
    "     - Filter data for specific storm events or time periods if needed.\n",
    "     - Create new columns for analysis (e.g., total damage).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Analyze**\n",
    "   - **Descriptive Analysis**\n",
    "     - Count unique storm events by type.\n",
    "     - Calculate total injuries, deaths, and property damage.\n",
    "   - **Geospatial Analysis**\n",
    "     - Use latitude and longitude data to plot storm origins on a map.\n",
    "     - Identify regions most affected by specific storm types.\n",
    "   - **Trends and Patterns**\n",
    "     - Analyze trends over time (e.g., increase in storm frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Share**\n",
    "   - **Visualizations**\n",
    "     - Create graphs and maps to illustrate key findings.\n",
    "     - Use interactive maps for better engagement.\n",
    "   - **Interpret Results**\n",
    "     - Summarize insights from the data (e.g., most common storms, geographic hotspots).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Act**\n",
    "   - **Recommendations**\n",
    "     - Provide actionable insights based on findings.\n",
    "     - Suggest further areas for research or monitoring based on trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Ensure to document each step with comments and markdown cells to explain your thought process and findings.\n",
    "- Include visualizations at appropriate points to enhance understanding.\n"
